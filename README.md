# Master's Thesis 2023

This master's thesis is the result of two semesters spent exploring matroids in the context of fair allocation. The work includes

- Implementing and optimizing Knuth's algorithm for random matroid generation in Julia
- Building a library for working with these randomly generated matroids, with an eye towards studying fair allocation with matroids
- Implementing some recent fair allocation algorithms that require matroids
  - Matroid rank utility functions
  - Matroid constraints
- Investigating the behavior of these allocation algorithms with random matroids

Other potential avenues to explore

- Generating matroids in other ways (graphic, vector, ???)
- ???
