\chapter{Fair allocation with matroid rank utilities}
We wish to study fair allocation in which the utility function of each agent is a matroid rank function. That is, the utility function for each agent $i \in [n]$ is the rank function for a matroid $\mathfrak{M}_i = ([m], \mathcal{I}_i)$.

$S_i \in \mathcal{I}_i \iff v_i(S_i) = |S_i|.$
