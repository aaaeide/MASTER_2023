	abstract = {The Higgs factorization of a strong map between matroids on a fixed set is that factorization into elementary maps in which each matroid is the Higgs lift of its successor. This factorization is characterized by properties of the modular filters which induce the elementary maps of the factorizations in two different ways. It is also shown to be minimal in a natural order on factorizations arising from the weak-map partial order on matroids. The notion of essential nullity of flats of a matroid is introduced; this quantity is nonzero precisely for the cyclic flats, and is shown to be related to the minimal flats of the modular filters inducing the maps of the Higgs factorization.},

	abstract = {For three different bankruptcy problems, the 2000-year old Babylonian Talmud prescribes solutions that equal precisely the nucleoli of the corresponding coalitional games. A rationale for these solutions that is independent of game theory is given in terms of the Talmudic principle of equal division of the contested amount; this rationale leads to a unique solution for all bankruptcy problems, which always coincides with the nucleolus. Two other rationales for the same rule are suggested, in terms of other Talmudic principles. (Needless to say, the rule in question is not proportional division).},
