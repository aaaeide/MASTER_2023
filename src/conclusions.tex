\section{Limitations}
What types of user preferences are we unable to represent using MRFs? Ref. Halpern's introduction; MRFs can model substitutes, but not complementaries (left shoe worthless without right shoe).

Little support exists in Julia for working with Multigraphs at the moment.

\section{Future work}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Exchange graphs, shortest path, augmentation. Stop recalculating everything after a transfer. Keep track of shortest paths, most will not change.
\end{enumerate}
