\chapter{Introduction}

One goal for this project is to create a library for the Julia programming language~\cite{bezanson2017julia}, supplying functionality for generating and interacting with (random) matroids. Throughout the text I will refer to this library as Matroids.jl. In the preparatory project delivered fall of 2022, I implemented Knuth's 1974 algorithm for the random generation of arbitrary matroids via the erection of closed sets \cite{knuth-1975}. With this, I was able to randomly generate matroids of universe sizes $n \leq 12$, but for larger values of $n$ my implementation was unbearably slow.
