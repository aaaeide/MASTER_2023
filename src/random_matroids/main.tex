\chapter{Generating matroids}
\label{chap:generating_matroids}
The overarching goal for this project is to make Matroids.jl, a proof-of-concept library for working programmatically with matroids, specifically in the context of fair allocation. This chapter covers how Matroids.jl enables the creation of specific matroids and the generation of random ones, as well as how to access important properties such as independent sets, closed sets, circuits, bases, the rank function and the closure function. The first part of the chapter focuses on implementing these features for uniform and graphic matroids. The latter part of this chapter describes the implementation of Knuth's algorithm~\cite{knuth-1975} for the erection of arbitrary rank-$r$ matroids. Getting this algorithm to work represents a significant portion of the project as a whole, and its successful implementation is one of the main achievements of this thesis.

This chapter consists of one section per matroid type this version of Matroids.jl supports. For each type, I describe how the matroid is represented, how to acquire the properties of the matroid, and how it might be randomly generated. Which matroid properties Matroids.jl will have dedicated functions for getting is based on the discussion in the previous chapter, wherein I described how the more high-level functions exposed in the Matroids.jl API are implemented. Naturally, access to a matroid's rank function and independence oracle is of paramount importance---one of these are required by all higher-level functionality. The threshold function for PROPX$_0$ gave a use case for the closure function. Hence, the properties for which Matroids.jl implements getter functions for every matroid: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \jlinl{rank(M, S)} returns the rank of the set \jlinl{S} in the matroid \jlinl{M}.
  \item \jlinl{is_indep(M, S)} returns whether the set \jlinl{S} is independent in the matroid \jlinl{M}.
  \item \jlinl{closure(M, S)} returns the closure of the set \jlinl{S} in the matroid \jlinl{M}, ie. the closed set of least rank that contains \jlinl{S}
\end{enumerate}
While the independence of a set $S$ could trivially be determined by checking whether $v(S) = |S|$, there is often a faster way of determining purely the independence without actually calculating the rank. With these functions in hand, one can procure the other basic properties of a matroid with relative ease---for instance, a circuit oracle checking whether a given set is a circuit could be implemented like this:
\begin{jllisting}
is_circuit(M, S) = rank(M, S) == length(S) - 1
\end{jllisting}


\section{Uniform matroids}
We start off lightly with the most basic type of matroid---the uniform matroid. Recall that the uniform matroid $U_n^r$ is the matroid over $n$ elements where the independent sets are exactly the sets of cardinality at most $r$. Two useful special cases of the uniform matroid on $n$ elements are the rank-$n$ free matroid, in which every subset of $E$ is independent, and the rank-$0$ zero matroid, in which only the empty set is independent.

\begin{jllisting}
struct UniformMatroid
  n::Integer
  r::Integer
end

FreeMatroid(n) = UniformMatroid(n, n)
ZeroMatroid(n) = UniformMatroid(n, 0)
\end{jllisting}

Extracting the properties of $U_n^r$ is a simple matter. The rank of a subset $S\subseteq E$ is given by $\max{|S|, r}$. $S$ is independent iff $|S|\leq r$. The closure of $S$ is $S$ if $|S| \leq r$ (since every larger set has higher rank), elsewise it is $E$.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{jllisting}    
rank(M::UniformMatroid, S) = min(length(S), M.r)
is_indep(M::UniformMatroid, S) = length(S) <= M.r
closure(M::UniformMatroid, S) = length(S) < M.r ? S : ground_set(M)
\end{jllisting}
\end{figure}

\section{Graphic matroids}
Graphic matroids were introduced back in Chapter~\ref{chap:prelims}, but in this chapter, I describe how Matroids.jl represents and randomly generates them.

First, some definitions for the graph theory terms used in this section. An undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ is said to be \textit{connected} if there exists at least one path between each pair of nodes in the graph; otherwise it is \textit{disconnected}. A disconnected graph consists of at least two connected subsets of nodes. These connected subgraphs are called \textit{components}.The \textit{degree} of a node $v$ is the number of edges for which $v$ is an endpoint. A \textit{regular graph} is a graph in which all nodes have the same degree. An \textit{induced subgraph} $G[S]$, where $S$ is either a subset of the nodes of $G$ (in which case $G[S]$ is a \textit{node-induced subgraph}) or of the edges of $G$ (\textit{edge-induced}).

\subsection{Random graphs}
In order to generate random graphic matroid, we will need to generate random graphs, let us take a look at some of the options available to us for this. Luckily for us, random graphs has been an area of extensive study for more than sixty years, and several models with different properties exist.

The Erdős-Rényi (ER) model (also known as Erdős-Rényi-Gilbert~\cite{fienberg-2012}) picks uniformly at random a graph from among the $\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{M}$ possible graphs with $n$ nodes and $M$ edges, or, alternatively, constructs a graph with $n$ nodes where each edge is present with some probability $p$~\cite{erdos-1959, gilbert-1959}. This model produces mostly disconnected graphs, and the size distribution of its components with respect to the number of edges has been studied extensively. With $n$ nodes and fewer than $\frac{n}{2}$ edges, the resulting graph will almost always consist of components that are small trees or contain at most one cycle. As the number of edges exceeds $\frac{n}{2}$, however, the so-called ``giant'' component of size $\mathcal{O}(n)$ emerges, and starts to absorb the smaller components~\cite{janson1993birth}. The ER model is the oldest and most basic random graph model, and is often referred to simply as the random graph, denoted by $G(n,p)$.

Variations of the ER model have been developed by physicists and network scientists to produce phenomena commonly seen in real-world networks~\cite{fienberg-2012}. These variations include the Barabási-Albert model, which grows an initial connected graph using preferential attachment (a mechanism colloquially known as ``the rich get richer''), in which more connected nodes are more likely to receive new connections. This results in graphs in which a small number of nodes (``hubs'') have a significantly higher degree than the rest, creating a power-law distribution of node degrees. This property is known as scale-freeness and is thought to be a characteristic of the Internet~\cite{barabasi-albert}. 

Another approach is the Watts-Strogatz model, which starts with a ring lattice, a regular graph with $n$ nodes, each with degree $k$, and then rewires each edge with some probability $p$. By changing $p$, one is able to `tune' the graph between regularity (p=0) and disorder (p=1). For intermediate values of $p$, Watts-Strogatz produces so-called ``small-world'' graphs, which exhibit both a high degree of clustering (how likely two nodes with a common neighbor are to be adjacent), and short average distance between nodes. This phenomenon is found in many real-world networks, such as social systems or power grids~\cite{Watts-1998}.

\subsection{Generating random graphic matroids}
We will use the Graphs.jl library~\cite{Graphs2021} for handling graphs in Matroids.jl. This library has built-in functions for the random graph models described in the previous chapter\footnote{\href{https://docs.juliahub.com/Graphs/VJ6vx/1.4.1/generators/}{https://docs.juliahub.com/Graphs/VJ6vx/1.4.1/generators/}}. 
\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \begin{jllisting}
    
function random_ba_graph(m)
  k = rand([x for x in 1:ceil(Integer, sqrt(m)) if m\%x == 0])
  n = m ÷ k + k

  return barabasi_albert(n, k)
end

  \end{jllisting}
  \caption{Compute a Barabási-Albert model random graph with $m$ edges from random parameters}
  \label{code:random_ba_graph}
\end{figure}

When generating random matroids, we want to be able to specify the size of the ground set, and perhaps also have some say in the rank of the matroid. Let us see how we can achieve this with the random graph models we have discussed. The function \jlinl{barabasi_albert(n,k)} generates a Barabási-Albert model random graph with $n$ nodes. It starts with an initial graph of $k$ nodes, and adds the remaining $n-k$ nodes one at a time, each new node receiving $k$ edges via preferential attachment. Thus, the final graph has $|E| = (n-k)k$ edges. To specify a matroid with $m$ edges, we pick some $k$ that divides $m$ and solve for $n$. Figure~\ref{code:random_ba_graph} shows a snippet of Julia code that generates a Barabási-Albert model random graph with random parameters such that the number of edges is $m$.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \begin{jllisting}
    
function random_ws_graph(m)
  n = rand([x for x in 2:ceil(Integer, sqrt(2m)) if 2m\%x == 0 && iseven(x)])
  k = 2m ÷ n
  (k, n) = sort([n,k])

  return watts_strogatz(n, k, rand())
end

  \end{jllisting}
  \caption{Compute a Watts-Strogatz model random graph with $m$ edges from random parameters}
  \label{code:random_ws_graph}
\end{figure}

Remember that the rank of a graphic matroid is the size of a spanning tree over the graph, which is $n-1$ when the graph is connected. If we select a smaller $k$ from among the factors of $|E|$, we get a larger final rank, and vice versa. We can generate a Watts-Strogatz model random graph with the function \jlinl{watts_strogatz(n, k, β)}, where $n$ is the number of nodes, $k$ the node degree and $\beta$ the probability of rewiring. The number of edges of a regular graph with $n$ nodes and degree $k$ (and thus the size of the ground set of the induced graphic matroid) is given by $\frac{nk}{2}$, so $nk$ must be even. Figure~\ref{code:random_ws_graph} shows a snippet of Julia code that randomly generates a Watts-Strogatz model random graph with $m$ edges.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \begin{jllisting}
    
function random_er_graph(m)
  n = rand(trunc(Integer, m/2):3m)
  return erdos_renyi(n, m)
end

  \end{jllisting}
  \caption{Compute a Erdős-Rényi model random graph with $m$ edges and a randomly chosen number of edges}
  \label{code:random_er_graph}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{code:random_er_graph} shows a snippet of Julia code that generates a random Erdős-Rényi model random graph with $m$ edges. ER is the simplest model for our purposes, as the function \jlinl{erdos_renyi(nv, ne)} simply takes in the desired number of nodes and edges. The resulting graph consists of mostly small trees and single-cycle components for $m < \frac{n}{2}$~\cite{janson1993birth}. The code in Figure~\ref{code:random_er_graph} somewhat arbitrarily picks the number of vertices randomly in the range from $\frac{m}{2}$ to $3m$.


\subsection{Properties of random graphic matroids}


In Matroids.jl, we ``generate'' a graphic matroid by simply accepting some graph, and figure out the rank of the matroid using Kruskal's algorithm for maximal spanning forests, which runs in $\mathcal{O}(|E| \lg |E|)$ time~\cite{Cormen2009-zm}. This is shown in Figure~\ref{code:struct_graphicmatroid}. Implementing the methods for finding the properties of our graphic matroids is simple, as they reduce to well-known algorithms (implemented by Graphs.jl) for finding the properties of the graphs they are derived from. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{jllisting}
using Graphs

struct GraphicMatroid
  g::Graph
  n::Integer
  r::Integer
  GraphicMatroid(g::Graph) = new(g, ne(g), length(kruskal_mst(g)))
end
\end{jllisting}
\caption{Matroids.jl representation of a graphic matroid}
\label{code:struct_graphicmatroid}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The rank function.} The rank of a set $S\subseteq E$ is the size of a spanning forest of the subgraph induced by $S$, and can be found in $\mathcal{O}(|S| \lg |S|)$ time using Kruskal's algorithm. Figure~\ref{code:rank_graphic} gives the source code for the rank function on a graphic matroid.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{jllisting}
  function rank(m::GraphicMatroid, S)
  edgelist = [e for (i, e) in enumerate(edges(g)) if i in S]
  subgraph, _vmap = induced_subgraph(m.g, edgelist)
  return length(kruskal_mst(subgraph))
  end
\end{jllisting}
\caption{\jlinl{rank(m::GraphicMatroid, S)}}
\label{code:rank_graphic}
\end{figure}
  
\paragraph{The indepence oracle.} A set $S$ is independent if the subgraph induced by $S$ is acyclic. The \jlinl{is_cyclic} check provided by Graphs.jl uses a DFS behind the scenes\footnote{\href{https://docs.juliahub.com/Graphs/VJ6vx/1.4.1/pathing/\#Graphs.is\_cyclic}{https://docs.juliahub.com/Graphs/VJ6vx/1.4.1/pathing/\#Graphs.is\_cyclic}}, which runs in linear time~\cite{Cormen2009-zm}. Figure~\ref{code:indep_graphic} gives the source code for the independence oracle on a graphic matroid.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{jllisting}
function is_indep(m::GraphicMatroid, S)
  edgelist = [e for (i, e) in enumerate(edges(g)) if i in S]
  subgraph, _vmap = induced_subgraph(m.g, edgelist)
  return !is_cyclic(subgraph)
end
\end{jllisting}
\caption{\jlinl{is_indep(m::GraphicMatroid, S)}}
\label{code:indep_graphic}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{The closure function.} accepts a set of elements $S$, and returns the largest set of elements $\fn{cl}(S)$ such that $S \subseteq \fn{cl}(S) \subseteq E, \fn{r}(S) = r(cl(S))$. In a graph context, given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and an edge-induced subgraph $G[S] = (V', S), S\subseteq E$, this is the same as finding the largest edge-induced subgraph $G[T], S\subseteq T\subseteq E$, in which a spanning tree has the same number of edges as one in $G[S]$. Since the size of a spanning tree in $G[S]$ is given by $|V'|-1$, $G[T]$ cannot contain any edges to nodes not in $V'$, as this would increase the rank of $G[T]$. Therefore, we get that the closure of $S$ is the largest set $T$ of edges between nodes that are present in the edge-induced subgraph $G[S]$. Figure~\ref{code:closure_graphic} gives the source code for the closure function on a graphic matroid.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{jllisting}
function closure(m::GraphicMatroid, S)
  edgelist = [e for (i, e) in enumerate(edges(m.g)) if i in S]
  _sg, vmap = induced_subgraph(m.g, edgelist)
  return [e for e in edges(m.g) if [e.src, e.dst] ⊆ vmap]
end
\end{jllisting}
\caption{\jlinl{closure(m::GraphicMatroid, S)}}
\label{code:closure_graphic}
