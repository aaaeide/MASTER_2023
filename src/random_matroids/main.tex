\chapter{Generating matroids}
\epigraph{For simplicity, we also assume that every point in a geometry is a closed set. Without this additional assumption, the resulting structure is often described by the ineffably cacaphonic term "matroid", which we prefer to avoid in favor of the term "pregeometry".}{Gian-Carlo Rota \cite{crapo_rota_1970}}

If a mathematical structure can be defined or axiomatized in multiple different, but not obviously equivalent, ways, the different definitions or axiomatizations of that structure make up a cryptomorphism. The many obtusely equivalent definitions of a matroid are a classic example of cryptomorphism, and belie the fact that the matroid is a generalization of concepts in many, seemingly disparate areas of mathematics.

Matroids were first introduced by Hassler Whitney in 1935~\cite{whitney-1935}, in a seminal paper where he described two axioms for independence in the columns of a matrix, and defined any system obeying these axioms to be a ``matroid'' (which unfortunately for Rota is the term that has stuck). Whitney's key insight was that this abstraction of~~``independence'' is applicable to both matrices and graphs. As a result of this, the terms used in matroid theory are borrowed from analogous concepts in both graph theory and linear algebra. Matroids have also received attention from researchers in fair allocation, as their properties make them useful for modeling user preferences; for instance, matroid rank functions are a natural way of formally describing course allocation for students~\cite{benabbou-2021}. 

This chapter describes how Matroids.jl generates and represents various types of matroids, from the very basic uniform matroid to the erection of arbitrary matroids using Knuth's 1974 algorithm~\cite{knuth-1975}.
