Imagine you are a new dean at a large university, and your first task is allocating seats in courses to students for the coming semester\footnote{This example is due to Benabbou et al~\cite{Benabbou_2020}.}. Each student has applied for some subset of the courses available, and each course has a limit on the number of students it can accept. In addition, there are scheduling conflicts between courses, a limited number of seats per course, and the students have hard limits on the number of courses they can take in a semester. As a good dean, you wish to do this fairly, so that the students are happy with their allocations, and do not feel disfavored compared to the other students, and

efficiently, so that every student gets enough courses to make the expected progress on their grade. How would you go about solving this problem? Over lunch, you discuss your quandary with a colleague from the computer science department who immediately assuages <-for vanskelig ord! your fears by informing you that your problem is in fact an instance of indivisible fair allocation with matroid-rank valuations, a well-studied problem for which several algorithms exist! Eager to learn more, you ask your colleague to expound upon her cryptic remark.
